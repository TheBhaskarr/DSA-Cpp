## Introduction

This repository contains **Data Structures and Algorithms problems** solved in **C++** as part of my DSA practice.

Problems are categorized into topics such as:

- Arrays  
- Binary Search  

Each solution focuses on:

- Clean logic  
- Optimal time & space complexity  
- Interview-oriented problem solving  

This repository is part of my continuous effort to strengthen **DSA fundamentals** and prepare for **software engineering interviews**.
